# flars
Flars is a reimplementation of the Free/Libre Action Roleplaying game Engine ([flare-engine](https://github.com/flareteam/flare-engine)) v0.0x, written in Rust.
Requires the SDL2 and SDL_image 2.0 development libraries to be installed.
For instance, in Debian / Ubuntu this can be done with:
```bash
$ sudo apt install libsdl2{,-image}-dev
```
After that, the engine / game should be runnable using:
```bash
$ cargo run --release
```
